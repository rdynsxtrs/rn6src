Description: Go programming language compiler, linker, compiled stdlib
 The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more
 productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency
 mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore
 and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and
 modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the
 convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a
 fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed,
 interpreted language.
 .
 This is a dependency package that depends on the default Go toolchain and
 compiled standard library. It is only built on architectures that have a
 native toolchain ("gc compiler"). Packages that want to build with whichever
 of gc or gccgo is available should depend on golang-any.

 This is a dependency package that depends on the default Go toolchain and

 toolchain ("gc compiler") port. Because the gccgo and Go releases are not on
 the same schedule, it is not guaranteed that the version of the Go language
 provided by the version of gccgo that this package depends upon will match the
 version of this package.
