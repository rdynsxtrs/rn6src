wireguard-linux-compat (0.0.20200215-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  As wireguard transitions to a more stable implementation (and heads
  toward being upstreamed in the kernel itself), we will no longer
  automatically reload the module on upgrade, even if the metapackage is
  installed.  Instead, we will simply mark the system as "reboot
  required".

  See the discussion on
  https://salsa.debian.org/debian/wireguard-linux-compat/merge_requests/2
  for more details.
