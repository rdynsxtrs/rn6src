Package: python-cryptography-vectors
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${python:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Test vectors for python-cryptography (Python 2)
 The test vectors for the cryptography library are rather large; thus, they are
 broken out into their own package so that users who do not need to run the
 tests do not need to download and install them.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2 version of cryptography_vectors.
