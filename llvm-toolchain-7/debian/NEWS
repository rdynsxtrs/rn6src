llvm-toolchain-7 (1:7.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * llvm-toolchain packages are built using clang itself (stage2)
    - stage1 = build clang with gcc
    - stage2 = clang building itself
    This could lead to some unexpected (but rare) ABI issues.

llvm-toolchain-7 (1:7-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * From version 7, llvm-toolchain also provides libc++, libc++abi
    and OpenMP packages. Non-coinstallable on purpose.
  * Packages, binaries and libraries have been renamed.
    Instead of the X.Y naming, we moved to X to match the
    naming from upstream.
    As example, clang version 7 is named clang-7 (unlike clang-6.0)
