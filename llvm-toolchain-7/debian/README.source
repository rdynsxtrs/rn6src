All programs and libraries shipped in this package are trying to stay as close
as possible from upstream.

However, because of the objectives of Debian, besides paths, some changes are
made.

= File names =

* To make sure that most of the llvm-toolchain packages are co-installable,
files are installed in /usr/lib/llvm-X/
and symlinks are managed by the other package llvm-defaults


= CPU extensions =

* For x86, SSE2 extensions are disabled (and the target CPU is i686 instead of
  pentium4.

* For armel, uses float ABI instead of hard.

* For armv7-a, NEON extensions are disabled.

* For mips, FPXX is enabled.


= Libraries =

* sonames are created

* Build-ID are enabled
