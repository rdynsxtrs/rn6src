php-memcached (2.2.0-51-ge573a6e+2.2.0-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * PHP memcached extension is now compiled with igbinary, json and
    msgpack serializer support.  The memcached.serializer option in
    memcached.ini is set to 'php' to retain backwards compatibility.

    Change the memcached.serializer option to 'igbinary', 'json' or
    'msgpack' to use the different memcached serializer.  You will have to
    install php-igbinary package for igbinary serializer support and
    php-msgpack package for msgpack serializer support.
