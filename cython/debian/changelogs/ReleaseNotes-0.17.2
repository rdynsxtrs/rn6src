0.17.2 (2012-11-20)
===================

Features added
--------------

* ``cythonize()`` gained a best effort compile mode that can be used to
simply ignore .py files that fail to compile.

Bugs fixed
----------

* Replacing an object reference with the value of one of its cdef
attributes could generate incorrect C code that accessed the object after
deleting its last reference.

* C-to-Python type coercions during cascaded comparisons could generate
invalid C code, specifically when using the 'in' operator.

* "obj[1,]" passed a single integer into the item getter instead of a tuple.

* Cyclic imports at module init time did not work in Py3.

* The names of C++ destructors for template classes were built incorrectly.

* In pure mode, type casts in Cython syntax and the C ampersand operator
are now rejected. Use the pure mode replacements instead.

* In pure mode, C type names and the sizeof() function are no longer
recognised as such and can be used as normal Python names.

* The extended C level support for the CPython array type was declared too
late to be used by user defined classes.

* C++ class nesting was broken.

* Better checking for required nullary constructors for stack-allocated C++
instances.

* Remove module docstring in no-docstring mode.

* Fix specialization for varargs function signatures.

* Fix several compiler crashes.
