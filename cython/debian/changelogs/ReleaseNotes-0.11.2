 * Release date: May 20th 2009

I'm happy to announce the release of Cython 0.11.2.

New features:

 * There's now native complex floating point support! C99 complex will be used if complex.h is included, otherwise explicit complex arithmetic working on all C compilers is used. [Robert Bradshaw]


    cdef double complex a = 1 + 0.3j
    cdef np.ndarray[np.complex128_t, ndim=2] arr = \
        np.zeros(10, np.complex128)


 * Cython can now generate a main()-method for embedding of the Python interpreter into an executable (see #289) [Robert Bradshaw]

 * @wraparound directive (another way to disable arr[idx] for negative idx) [Dag Sverre Seljebotn]
 * Correct support for NumPy record dtypes with different alignments, and "cdef packed struct" support [Dag Sverre Seljebotn]
 * @callspec directive, allowing custom calling convention macros [Lisandro Dalcin]
 * Bug fixes and smaller improvements. For the full list, see [1].
