The Cython project is happy to announce the release of Cython 0.14.1. This release is primarily a bug fix release.

== New Features ==

 * The gdb debugging support was extended to include all major Cython features, including closures.

 * raise MemoryError() is now safe to use as Cython replaces it with the correct C-API call.

== General improvements and bug fixes ==

The bug tracker has a http://trac.cython.org/cython_trac/query?status=closed&group=component&order=id&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=component&milestone=0.14.1&desc=1

== Incompatible changes ==

 * Decorators on special methods of cdef classes now raise a compile time error rather than being ignored.

 * In Python 3 language level mode (-3 option), the 'str' type is now mapped to 'unicode', so that cdef str s declares a Unicode string even when running in Python 2.

== Contributors ==

Many people contributed to this release, including:

 * Stefan Behnel
 * Alexey Borzenkov
 * Robert Bradshaw
 * Lisandro Dalcin
 * Mark Florisson
 * W. Trevor King
 * Vitja Makarov

A special thanks also to the many people who did testing and contributed useful bug reports.
