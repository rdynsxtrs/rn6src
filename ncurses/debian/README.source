This package requires a non-standard autoconf version to regenerate the
'configure' scripts, available in the autoconf-dickey package.  If you
modify the build system, i.e. you make changes to configure.in,
aclocal.m4, test/configure.in or test/aclocal.m4, it is necessary to run
"autoreconf-dickey" afterwards.  The standard autoconf package is *not*
able to regenerate 'configure'.  See http://bugs.debian.org/580190 for
details.
