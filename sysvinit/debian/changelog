  * The init scripts provided by the bootlogd and initscripts package are
    specific to sysvinit/sysv-rc and should not be run when systemd is the

  * Drop obsolete Conflicts, Breaks and Replaces from pre-wheezy.
  * Drop Suggests: sash from sysvinit-utils. It is obsolete now that we use
    the sulogin implementation from util-linux.
  * Move Suggests: bootlogd from sysvinit-utils to sysvinit-core. Under
    systemd, bootlogd is non-functional. So only suggest its installation
    when sysvinit-core is the active init system. (Closes: #754443)
  * Document that /etc/default/{rcS,tmpfs} are ignored when systemd is the
    active init system. (Closes: #776963)
  * Drop transitional sysvinit package. It has served its purpose for the
    wheezy → jessie transition and keeping it around for longer only
    leads to confusion as it doesn't setup /etc/inittab which is necessary
    to boot with SysV. This functionality has moved into sysvinit-core,

sysvinit (2.88dsf-53.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Since the new "init" metapackage has taken over the role to ensure an init
    system is installed at all times, drop the Essential: yes flag from
    sysvinit and demote its priority to optional so this package is no longer
    pulled in on new installations on Linux. Make sysvinit depend on "init" so
    this new package is installed on upgrades.
  * Provide a fallback SysV init binary in the sysvinit package which can be
    used to boot the system via init=/lib/sysvinit/init even if systemd is the
    default init system and /sbin/init is provided by systemd-sysv.
  * Demote the priority of sysvinit-core to extra so it is no longer installed
    by default on Linux.

    - mount-functions.sh: Add -ocompatible to procfs mounts on Hurd.
    - mountall.sh: Use pidof -s /sbin/init for robustness.
    - checkroot.sh: Only run rootcheck on Linux. Neither kFreeBSD nor
      Hurd have /dev/root and the device ids used here are specific to
      Linux.
    - killall5.c: Use sysconf(_SC_SYMLOOP_MAX) instead of MAXSYMLINKS.
      Fixes build on Hurd.
    - sysvinit.postinst: Fix file name of gettys in /etc/inittab on
      Hurd.

      package lack the necessary functionality to boot Debian/Hurd
      using sysvinit.
    - Add runsystem.sysv that uses sysvinit to boot Debian/Hurd.

  * Introduce jessie changes from 2.88dsf-41+jessie1 to unstable.
  * Correct the Breaks on bootchart to ensure that all broken
    versions are removed on upgrade (Closes: #694252).  Break
    bootchart << 0.10~svn407-4 to ensure that 0.10~svn407-3.3
    and earlier are removed.
  * Clean up legacy migration logic in maintainer scripts and init
    scripts for /run, /lib/init/rw, /etc/mtab, /etc/motd.
  * Don't generate debian/copyright; include missing bits of
    COPYRIGHT directly.
  * Upgrade to Standards-Version 3.9.4 (no changes).
  * Add lintian overrides for init script dependency warnings;
    these don't apply to our scripts since they have special
    dependency requirements.
  * bootlogd: Ensure boot logs are flushed (Closes: #423528).  Save
    logs in /run/bootlog and copy to /var/log/boot at the end of the
    boot sequence.
  * sysv-rc:
    - update-rc.d no longer supports non-dependency-based boot.
      + Remove non-insserv codepaths.
      + Warn if the start or stop actions are used.
      + Skip runlevel mismatch warnings if default action is used
        (no arguments to validate).
      + Update manual page to remove start and stop actions, plus
        manual setting of boot sequence ordering; note that start
        and stop are no longer supported.  Closes: #606505.
  * initscripts:
    - Remove static runlevels from update-rc.d calls in postinst.
    - checkroot.sh skips fsck of btrfs filesystems.  Thanks to Ben
      Klein for this patch.  Closes: #701956.  Note that this is
      intended to be a workaround until such time btrfs provides a
      non-broken fsck.btrfs.
    - Remove use of absolute program paths in postinst.
  * bootlogd:
    - Remove static runlevels from update-rc.d calls in postinst.

  [ Pino Toscano ]
  * Update inittab.gnu to the new path of Hurd's getty.
  * mount-functions.sh: do not add "nodev" to the mount options also on Hurd,
    as this option does not exist there.

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * Kill pointless script-not-executable overrides for things that are not
    scripts.
  * /etc/default/rcS is a conffile; remove postinst code that attempts to
    create it from a non-existent template.
  * Relax the Breaks: on upstart for compatibility with Ubuntu.
  * Don't duplicate the /etc/default/rcS conffile with a template in the
    preinst; unmodified files should just be removed, and created
    automatically by dpkg.
  * Fix 'service $foo restart' implementation for upstart jobs.
  * Update service(8) manpage to document the support for upstart jobs.
  * debian/sysv-rc/sbin/invoke-rc.d: replace RUNLEVEL with RUNLEVELHELPER.
    Using RUNLEVEL causes spurious failures when invoke-rc.d is invoked
    with RUNLEVEL already defined in the environment (as it is e.g. during
    bootup) since invoke-rc.d's RUNLEVEL will become an exported variable
    at that point and cause /sbin/runlevel to return bad data. (LP: #619246)
    Thanks to James Troup for the patch.
  * Properly clean up bootlogd conffiles on upgrade using dpkg-maintscript,
    instead of leaving them orphaned on the filesystem when the bootlogd
    package is not installed.
  * Drop maintainer script migration code for versions older than squeeze.
  * Mark sysv-rc Multi-Arch: foreign, now that debhelper is generating
    versioned dependencies on it, this is important for cross-installability
    of packages providing services.  Closes: #710304.
  * Also mark initscripts Multi-Arch: foreign, for similar reasons.  This is
    probably less important, given that the number of packages affected is
    small and the /run transition is already past, but it is still correct
    in its own right so might as well be added.  Closes: #677369.

      entirely under the control of the system administrator.  If
      /etc/motd is a symlink to /run/motd, /etc/motd.tail is moved
      back to /etc/motd.  Closes: #353229, #624391, #668307.  /etc/motd
      is not removed if initscripts is purged, since it's not owned by
      initscripts.
    - By default, /run/motd is just the output of uname, preserving the

      include dynamic information in the motd, they may write scripts
      to update /run/motd.dynamic as they please.  Closes: #437176.
    - motd generation is split from bootlogs into a separate motd

    - bootlogs init script has been removed; current logging daemons
      handle this themselves, making this script redundant.
    - tmpfs mounts are never cleaned by bootclean.sh.  Cleaning /run

      in startpar.
  * initscripts:
    - Moved RAM* settings from /etc/default/rcS to /etc/default/tmpfs.
      This ensures that the settings are equivalent for upgrades and
      new installations, but will require manual configuration of the
      settings for upgrades (no migration from /etc/default/rcS to
      /etc/default/tmpfs will take place, due to tmpfs being a
      conffile).  tmpf(5) manual page added to document all aspects
      of tmpfs configuration, including the existing documentation in
      rcS(5).
    - Drop the use of .ramfs dotfiles in /run and /run/lock.  These
      were a legacy of /lib/init/rw and were not actually used by
      anything.  Closes: #403863.
    - Drop /etc/init.d/mountoverflowtmp.  This has been merged into
      the general tmpfs on /tmp handling functions.  This means the
      generic RAMTMP configuration is used for the overflowtmp.
      Closes: #567539.
    - It is now possible to configure a tmpfs mount size limit as a
      percentage of the total VM size (%VM) as well as a percentage
      of the RAM size (%).  This is computed by tmpfs.sh and the
      tmpfs mounts are remounted with the updated size limit after
      swap becomes available.
    - An fstab entry for /tmp overrides RAMTMP.  Document tmpfs
      override and tmpfs defaults in tmpfs(5), also undeprecating the
      tmpfs settings.  Closes: #585540, #665995.
    - An fstab entry for /run/lock or /run/shm overrides RAMLOCK and
      RAMSHM.
    - bootclean cleans /tmp, /run and /run/lock before any filesystems
      are mounted as well as after local and network mounts.  This
      permits cleaning of directories which would otherwise be hidden
      by mountpoints later in the boot process.
      Closes: #55707, #558000, #666871.  Additionally clean up
      /lib/init/rw in case any files were hidden by the (now removed)
      tmpfs mount at this location.  Closes: #652625.

sysvinit (2.88dsf-13.5) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Roger Leigh ]
  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Unify mount logic shared between mountkernfs.sh, mountdevsubfs.sh
    and mtab.sh
    - all functions use domount() from /lib/init/mount-functions.  This
      merges in the functionality of domtab() in mtab.sh, which was
      almost entirely identical.  domount is now capable of mounting and
      remounting (with and without mtab updates) as well as updating
      /etc/mtab.
    - mtab.sh calls mountkernfs.sh and mountdevsubfs with an "mtab"
      argument to do the mtab generation for early mounts.  This means
      that the mount logic is not needlessly duplicated, and does not
      require two copies to be kept exactly in sync.  This reduces the
      risk of problems as a consequence of subtle differences between
      the two scripts.
    - mount options may be specified in either /etc/default/tmpfs or
      in /etc/fstab, and will supersede hard coded defaults.  The
      the values in fstab (if any) will supersede those in
      /etc/default/tmpfs should an entry be present.  These values are
      also used for remounting, which means that filesystems mounted in
      an initramfs and moved onto the root filesystem prior to init
      starting will be remounted with the correct user-specified
      options.
    - Improve robustness of stat checks when comparing directories.
    - mountkernfs.sh and mountdevsubfs.sh are idempotent, so allow for
      repeated invocation.  This is needed to allow the same code to
      be used for mounting, remounting and mtab generation.
    - Enabling RAMLOCK, RAMSHM and RAMTMP in /etc/default/rcS is no longer
      required if the filesystems are present in /etc/fstab
  * /etc/default/tmpfs is deprecated
    - If changing the default size limits, adding an entry to /etc/fstab
      is preferred compared with editing /etc/default/tmpfs.  This also
      permits modifying the default mount options, and setting additional
      mount options.
    - If /etc/default/tmpfs has been modified from the defaults, any
      needed entries will be created in /etc/fstab on upgrade, to
      preserve the settings from /etc/default/tmpfs.  The entries in
      /etc/fstab will subsequently override the settings in
      /etc/default/tmpfs.
  * The mount options for /run are made stricter when possible.  For
    example, if /run/shm is a separate filesystem, it may be safely
    mounted with "noexec".
  * Compatibility symbolic links are relative, not absolute.  e.g.
    /var/lock is ../run/lock rather than /run/lock.  This means that if
    you're using a chroot from the host system, you'll always be using
    locations in the chroot, rather than the host, when following the
    links.
  * Updated documentation in initscripts README.Debian and rcS(5).

sysvinit (2.88dsf-13.3) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Roger Leigh ]
  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Support for new top-level directory /run to replace /var/run,
    /var/lock, /dev/shm and /lib/init/rw as a place to store transient
    writable data which should not be preserved across a system
    reboot (Closes: #186892, #616571, #620191).  /run fixes existing
    issues with RAMRUN and RAMLOCK options using tmpfs on /var/run and
    /var/lock (Closes: #423405, #481546, #564635, #607136, #620735).
    Additionally, /run/shm replaces /dev/shm and may share the same
    tmpfs as /run if RAMSHM is set to "no" in /etc/default/rcS.  /tmp
    may also be configured to be a tmpfs if RAMTMP is set to "yes" in
    /etc/default/rcS.  /tmp may also be configured to use /run directly if
    it is symlinked to /run/tmp, for example.
    Summary:
      /var/run → /run
      /var/lock → /run/lock
      /dev/shm → /run/shm
      /lib/init/rw → /run (not transitioned automatically)
      /dev/.* → /run (not transitioned automatically)
    These changes do not take effect until the system is rebooted as
    is currently done for /lib/init/rw setup.  Prior to a reboot, the
    paths are made available via bind/nullfs/firmlink mounts, depending on
    the platform.  Following a reboot, the old paths will be converted to
    symlinks, or bind/nullfs/firmlink mounts where symlinking is not
    possible, to allow access via either the old or new paths, to permit
    programs using the old paths to transition to use the new paths for
    wheezy.
    - debian/initscripts.postinst:
      Take chroot detection logic from udev postinst (existing logic was
      broken).  Add detection logic for vserver environments and Hurd.
      Trigger reboot to complete transition.
      If the system has not yet transitioned to a tmpfs-based /run, set up
      bind mounts as follows:
        /var/run → /run
        /var/lock → /run/lock
        /dev/shm → /run/shm
      On reboot, the system will complete the migration to a tmpfs-based
      /run; this creates the directory heierachy from the old paths to
      enable the use of the new /run paths prior to a restart.  This means
      packages may transition to using /run with a versioned dependency
      upon initscripts.
      Remove special handling for RAMRUN and RAMLOCK, which is now taken
      care of by /run.
      If in a chroot environment, just create symlinks from the new names
      to the existing locations, since otherwise the changes would be
      lost, and since rcS scripts aren't run the transition won't
      complete.

  * Drop execution of files in /etc/rc.boot from sysv-rc.  This feature
    have been obsolete since before 1999.  Remove the rc.boot(5) manual
    page from the source as well.
  * Make init.d/rc.local depend on $all to get it to start later in
    the boot sequence (Closes: #539084).
  * Rewrite message from update-rc.d to make it more obvious that both
    start and stop symlinks are taken into account (Closes: #519553).
  * Rewrite /etc/rcS.d/README and /etc/rc[2-5].d/README to explain how
    to disable a service at a given runlevel with the dependency based
    boot sequencing.  Remove the list of well known sequence numbers
    in rcS.d/ that is no longer valid with dependency based boot
    sequencing.
  * Make sysv-rc Breaks: initscripts (<< 2.86.ds1-63) to make sure
    scripts working with makefile style concurrent booting is
    installed.  Not using dependency to avoid circular dependency
    between initscripts and sysv-rc.
  * Move the code to migrate to dependency based boot sequencing
    during upgrades from the insserv package to the sysv-rc package.
    Depend on insserv (>> 1.12.0-10) for this.  Let initscripts depend
    on sysv-rc | file-rc to make sure they are installed first.
    Migration is a one-way process, enabled after a critical debconf
    question during upgrades when it is safe to do so (Closes:
    #540546, #541041, 541604).  Checks previously done by
    update-bootsystem-insserv are now only done once in sysv-rc
    postinst (Closes: #538934).  Dependency based boot sequencing is
    now the default.  This change make it possible to remove both
    sysv-rc and insserv (Closes: #538959) if other packages want to
    take over the boot sequencing resposibility.
  * Rewrite initscripts postinst to always use the update-rc.d script
    instead of the legacy updatercd() function which was used as a
    speed optimization no longer relevant when dependency based boot
    sequencing is the default.

  * Update patch header for all remaining patches.
  * Call dpkg-shlibdeps debian/startpar/startpar for sysvinit-utils package
    and not sysvinit, startpar moved in revision 2.86.ds1-62.
  * Remove checkdir, checkroot and buildfromsvn targets from
    debian/rules.  The latter is unused by current maintainers and the
    former can be replaced with dh_testdir and dh_testroot instead.
  * Fix reject hunk of debian/patches/70_compiler_warnings.dpatch to
    fix another compile warning.
  * Make sure update-rc.d compares command line parameters for start/stop
    runlevel configuration with the Default-Start and Default-Stop values in
    LSB info comment of script and warns if there are differences.
  * Update sysv-rc debconf templates with text which help explain
    dependency based boot to end users, and provide sound advice for
    people who encounter problems which prevent the migration.
  * Update inittab.kfreebsd-gnu: On GNU/kFreeBSD the serial devices have
    change from /dev/cuuaX to  /dev/ttydX in kernel 6.0 which is minumum
    kernel currently supported in Debian. (Closes: #544555)

    procps, pcmcia, hwclock, hwclockfirst, hibernate-clean and hdparm,

  * Extend the update-rc.d(8) manual page to document the new behaviour.
    Do not install translated update-rc.d manual pages until they
    are updated to reflect this.
  * Use versioned conflict on chkconfig (<< 11.0-79.1-2), now that it
    dropped the service command (Closes: #541727).
  * Drop unneeded dependency rmnologin from init.d/stop-bootlogd, and
    correct $remote_fs dependency to $local_fs, as /usr/ is not aused.
  * Drop unneeded dependency on udev for init.d/bootlogs, and add ldm
    and sdm to list of display managers to start after to get the
    complete list.
  * Extend boot order migration check to reject migration if init.d
    scripts from removed but not purged packages are present.
  * Add $syslog as a dependency for init.d/skeleton, as it should
    be used in the normal case.
  * Change init.d/urandom dependency from $local_fs to $remote_fs, as
    it uses /usr/bin/find to handle locally increased pool size
    (Closes: #543294).
  * Drop initscripts conflict on insserv (<< 1.09.0-12), now that
    sysv-rc depend on insserv (>> 1.12.0-10).
  * Drop initscripts conflict on udev (<< 0.080-1), which was
    before the current oldstable was released.
  * Drop initscripts conflict on usplash (<< 0.5.8-2), which was
    before the current stable was released.
  * Remove code in init.d/killprocs to restart /sbin/update, as it is
    only useful for kernels up to linux 2.2, which is no longer
    supported (Closes: #544249).  Thanks to Marco d'Itri for the tip.
  * Update Standards-Version from 3.8.2 to 3.8.3.  No changes needed.
  * Add code in initscripts.postrm to remove rc settings for init.d
    scripts on removal to follow policy and keep lintian happy, even
    though removing initscripts will leave the system unbootable.
    Update lintian overrides to reflect this.

  * Use X-Interactive flag in LSB headers of those scripts that should
    run on their own, based on the current content of insserv.conf.
    Dropped interactive flag from hostname.sh, mountkernfs.sh and

  * Update startpar source to upstream 0.52 (from 0.50) and apply debian
    compatibility patch (sent upstream). Also workaround /dev/pts not
    being mounted early in runlevel S by having startpar use an own
    version of getpt(2) system call. (Closes: #457896, #484883)
  * Enable CONCURRENCY=makefile mode in debian/sysv-rc/etc/init.d/rc.
    This mode uses startpar and the /etc/init.d/.depend.* makefile-like
    information created by insserv to calculate boot script execution
    order. The splash API is not supported in this mode of boot. This
    mode of boot is considered very experimental at this time.
  * Allow startpar using concurrency modes to operate in runlevel S, now
    that startpar can manage to work properly in absence of /dev/pts.

    lintian warning. Patch taken from diff on LP: #312764.
  * Add comment to debian/sysv-rc/etc/init.d/rc about debug=echo, it
    should never be left uncommented for a real boot process and should
    only be used for interactive debugging. (Closes: #510455)
  * Do not mount usbfs any more, it was deprecated long ago.
    Applications should all use /dev/bus/usb, which can be managed more

    is shown. Check that last argument to start|stop command is a period
    earlier. Thanks to Patrick <pet@painfullscratch.nl>.  (Closes: #512003)

  * Make init.d/rc simpler by dropping support for sourcing .sh files
    after the policy finally changed in 3.8.1.  Update to Standards
    version 3.8.1. (Closes: #339955, #519520)
  * Allow initscripts postinst maintainer script to not fail when
    attempting to mkdir /dev/pts and /dev/shm when running in a
    fakechroot environment. This is done by checking for FAKECHROOT env
    variable before bailing out. Patch thanks to Daniel Kahn Gillmor.

  * Rewrite libata shutdown handling to use patch from
    Werner Fink at SuSe to handle each disk individually and
    automatically instead of guessing in the init.d script how
    to handle them collectively (Closes: #426224).  This removes
    the HDDOWN variable from /etc/default/halt.
  * Improve usage information in update-rc.d by using the same
    notation as the one used in the manual page (Closes: #268713)
  * Implement noswap kernel boot option to stop automatic
    swap activation at boot time (Closes: #388525).  Based on patch
    from Michael Prokop.
  * Rewrite init.d/rc to use shell features instead of calling sed
    (Closes: #406393).  Patch from Ivan Baldo.
  * Fix typo in update-rc.d example code (Closes: #433378).
  * Fix minor typo in rc*.d/README files (Closes: #452384).
  * Make sure init.d/rc do not complain because the new progress bar
    API is unavailable (Closes: #457544).
  * New patch 26_last_ipv6 from Fedora to recognize more IPv6
    addresses.
  * Extend the 68_init_quiet patch based on patch from Fedora to also
    suppress the "Switching to runlevel" message.  This patch is
    currently disabled because the 'quiet' flag is removed by the
    kernel when init is called.
  * New patch 69_init_waiting from Fedora to make sure the init
    waiting status is preserved across re-exec.
  * New patch 41_utmp_64bit from Fedora to avoid writing past the
    utmp.ut_tv struct on 64 bit architectures. (Closes: #450543)
  * New patch 64_init_init_reexec_env from Fedora to fix typo.  Now

  * Move /etc/init.d/bootclean to /lib/init/bootclean, as it is not an
    init.d script but a library.
  * Acknowledge NMU. (Closes: #433386)
  * Make /lib/init/vars.sh usable when 'set -e' is in effect.  Patch

    killall5 patches together.
  * New patch 82_killall_exclude_pids.dpatch adding new option -o
    to killall5, to omit killing the pid given on the command line.
    Based on patch from Ubuntu. (Closes: #453042)
  * Use new killall5 -o option in init.d/sendsigs, reading pids to
    omit from /var/run/sendsigs.omit.  This make it possible to list

    in recent ltsp versions.  Based on patch from Ubuntu.
  * Add linux-gnulp to debian/deps-mount, to get the correct behaviour
    with regard to initscripts dependencies on lpia.  Patch from Adam
    Conrad in Ubuntu.
  * Add splash screen / progress bar API to initscripts in
    /lib/init/splash-functions-base, overridable by the splash
    implementations in /lib/init/splash-functions.  Based on patch
    from David Härdeman. (Closes: #423095)  Make initscripts conflict
    with usplash (<< 0.5) to make sure a version with PULSATE support
    is used.
  * Rewrite init.d/rc progress bar support to use new API.  Move
    usplash calls to separate file splash-functions-usplash.  This
    file should be moved to the usplash package. Based on patch from
    David Härdeman.
  * Do not mount gfs2 as a local file system.  It is a network file system.
    Patch from  Guido Guenther (Closes: #454468).
  * Modify update-rc.d to refuse to install init.d scripts with illegal
    characters in the names.  Only accept [a-zA-Z0-9+.-] to match the
    limits on package names.  Correct handling of init.d scripts with

  * Make sure running update-rc.d several times do not remove the
    rc*.d/ symlinks, fixing bug introduced in 2.86.ds1-16.  Patch from
    Arjan Oosting. (Closes: #386500) Added entry in NEWS file to give
    clues on how to fix the breakage in upgraded packages introduced
    by this.  Print a warning when upgrading from the broken versions.
  * Change checkroot.sh to use a private tmpfs file system for its
    device file if it is missing from /dev/. (Closes: #386347)
  * Also create possibly non-existant parent directory of lock directory
    /var/run/network/mountnfs in ifup script.  Patch from Arjan
    Oosting. (Closes: #386449).
  * Mark /etc/init.d/rc.local as a conffile, to make sure we do not
    replace an exisitng rc.local file without warning the system
    admin. (Closes: #386418)
  * Mount /dev/pts/ with noexec,nosuid, as it is only used for device files.
  * Change sysv-rc to print a message when enabling concurrent boot,
    specifying the concurrency style.  Recommend lsb-base and use it
    if available.
  * Teach init.d/stop-bootlogd-single to accept the kernel arguments
    'S' and '1' as well as 'single' as single-user mode triggers.
    (Closes: #367465, #372669)
  * Only report umounting of remote file systems when there are remote
    file systems to umount.
  * Remove 'S' from default-stop in skeleton.  It never make sense to add
    stop links in rcS.d/.
  * Remove execute bit from /etc/init.d/skeleton. (Closes: #372666)
  * LSB header updates:
    - stop-bootlogd should run after rmnologin.
    - mountdevsub.sh should start after udev, if it exist.
    - rc.local should not depend on $all to allow it to start earler
      in the boot.
    - stop-bootlogd-single should depend on $all, to get it last in
      the rcS.d/ sequence.
    - umountnfs.sh should stop in runlevel 0 and 6, and execute before
      umountnfs, sendsigs, portman and $network.
    - sendsigs should stop in runlevel 0 and 6, and execute before
      umountfs.
    - umountfs should stop in runlevel 0 and 6, and execute before halt
      or reboot, if it exist.
    - halt should stop in runlevel 0, and not run before any other script.
    - reboot should stop in runlevel 6, and not run before any other script.

  * Fix emergency mode's tty, making sure ^C and ^Z work when booting
    with 'emergency' kernel option.  Patch from Samuel
    Thibault. (Closes: #374543)
  * Rewrite usplash reactivation code in init.d/sendsigs to match the
    code in Ubuntu.  It need to behave the same way as the usplash
    startup code, and should not match the code deciding if
    usplash_write should be used.
  * Change handling of CONCURRENCY in init.d/rc, to make sure an
    unrecognized value is treated as 'none'. (Closes: #380602)
  * Make sure SATA disks are powered down as well as IDE disks.  Patch
    from Sebastian Reichelt.  (Closes: #348172)
  * Mount /dev/shm, /sys, /proc and /proc/bus/usb using
    noexec,nodev,nosuid to make it harder to misuse.
    (Closes: #378182, #378280)
  * Move NFS mounting to an if-up.d script, to make sure we try to
    mount NFS file systems after the network is available.  Based on
    patch from Ubuntu.  Modified to rewrite mountnfs.sh instead of
    renaming it to waitnfs.sh.  (Closes: #360123)
  * Add rc.local support to be more compatible with non-Debian
    distributions.  Patch from Fabio M. Di Nitto via Ubuntu.  Modified to
    not print messages when VERBOSE=no.
  * Drop and remove /etc/init.d/mountvirtfs.  It is obsolete.
  * Do not try to mount netdev file systems in mountall.sh.
    (Closes: #383073, #386063)
  * Mount netdev file systems when the network is up. (Closes: #383123)
  * Umount netdev file systems in umountnfs.sh. (Closes: #383124)
  * Remove obsolete code in init.d/rc to execute /sbin/unconfigured.sh
    and /sbin/setup.sh.  It was only to be used during installation,
    and the installer no longer need it.  Add a init.d script if you
    need the functionallity.
  * Change LSB dependency info for mtab.sh.  It need a writable root
    file system to update /etc/mtab, and should thus depend on
    checkroot, not mountall.
  * Move mtab to rcS.d/S12mtab.sh, to make sure it is the first script
    to run after checkroot.sh.
  * Change init.d/mtab.sh to be more self-contained, and update
    /etc/mtab with info on all file systems mounted before /etc/mtab
    was writable by processing /proc/mounts.  Based on patch from
    Scott James Remnant and Ubuntu.
  * Add empty functions pre_mountall and post_mountall to reduce the
    difference between the Ubuntu version
  * Modify update-rc.d to run properly with perl error checking enabled.
  * Add support for parsing LSB headers in update-rc.d, and use the
    runlevel information in the default-start and default-stop headers
    if they are present.  Document this in update-rc.d(8).  This can
    be used instead of the 'multiuser' extention in Ubuntu, by setting
    the 'default-stop' value to '1' in the init.d script.
    Only enable this feature when /etc/update-rc.d-lsbparse exist
    while we verify that LSB headers are correct.
  * Change the default VERBOSE value from yes to no.
  * Move init.d/hostname.sh to the very top of the boot sequence,
    as it only require a readable /etc/hostname and a working kernel.
  * Use the stop scripts from the runlevel we are leaving, not the one
    we are entering, when switching between runlevels. (Closes: #309813)

  * Update the LSB descripton header for init.d/hostname.sh.
  * Make sure hostname.sh return error code when it fail. (Closes: #365062)
  * Fix 'startpar' concurrency option to only run start and stop

  * Fix init.d/rc to make it possible to specify the CONCURRENCY
    setting in /etc/default/rcS.
  * Fix typo in update-rc.d.8 manual page.  Patch from Justin

  * Improve text in init.d/README to make it more obvious that the .sh

    from Bart Martens.  (Closes: #362888)
  * Modify the comment before the conditional calls to on_ac_power, to
    document that checkfs.sh and checkroot.sh are written to work just
    fine also when /usr/bin/on_ac_power is unavailable. (Closes: #367867)
  * Integrate the patches from Ubuntu where I understand why they are
    useful:
    - Change runlevel manpage to be less misleading.
    - Make messages in init.d/sendsigs less technical.  Based on patch
      from Ubuntu.
    - Update progress bar changes in init.d/sendsigs and init.d/rc.
      Based on patch from Ubuntu.  Changed patch to check only once in
      init.d/rc if the progress bar is enabled, and to use the same
      way in sendsigs and rc to decide if it is enabled or not.  It
      will be enabled if /sbin/usplash_write is executable.
    - If /dev/.udev.log exists, move it to /var/log/udev.log.  Patch
      from Scott James Remnant.
    - Do not umount /dev/shm in umountnfs.sh.  It is a tmpfs and can be
      safely left behind when shutting down the system.

    symbolic link.  The EDITMOTD variable no longer has any effect; to
    disable updating of the motd just point the /etc/motd symlink to a
    static file such as /etc/motd.static.
  * bootmisc.sh: Rotate dmesg log with savelog (Closes: #237074)
    and chgrp adm.
  * umountroot: Change mount command in order to exclude bind mounts of
    the root directory  (Closes: #339023)
  * Replace /etc/rc1.d/20single by /etc/rc1.d/S30killprocs and
    /etc/rc1.d/S99single so that packages can insert scripts to do
    things between the "killall5" in the former and the "exec init -t1 S"
    in the latter.  This may help to address #145280.
  * umountfs: Unmount tmpfs before swapoff and other fs's afterwards
    (Closes: #328582, hopefully without reopening #84782)
  * Make stop-bootlogd a distinct script rather than a symlink to bootlogd.
    Give it its own LSB header.
  * Add stop-bootlogd-single initscript to stop bootlogd in "single" mode
    (Closes: #213028, #220025)
  * checkfs.sh: Implement FSCKTYPES  (Closes: #89481)  Set, e.g.,
    FSCKTYPES="ext2,msdos" to fsck only file system types ext2 and msdos
    See fsck(8) for syntax.  FSCKTYPES="none" disables fsck of file
    systems (other than the root filesystem) altogether.
  * all initscripts: Set variables using common script
  * all initscripts: Fix usage messages
  * all initscripts: Allow VERBOSE to be set via the INIT_VERBOSE=yes
    kernel argument (Closes: #286082)  Experimental.  The name of the
    kernel argument may change in the future if we decide to implement
    this more generally.
  * Improve skeleton initscript
  * all scripts: Clean up; standardize indentation
  * all scripts: Use the "which" program to test for executability
  * initscripts: Experimentally include /run; include /sys in Linux
    builds
  * mountvirtfs: Mount a tmpfs on /run
  * mountvirtfs: Warn if mount point has stuff under it (Closes: #95390)
  * initscripts postinst: Mount virtual filesystems
  * initscripts preinst: Remove ancient /etc/init.d/boot conversion code
    (Closes: #343596)
  * default config files: Clean up comments
  * Make initscripts Depend on debianutils >= 2.13.1 in order to prevent
    #295850.  Note that debianutils also has to be >= 2.12.0 so that the
    "which" program is available in /bin.
  * Remove currently unneeded sysvinit Dependency on coreutils
    (Closes: #316423)
  * pidof: If the program is specified with a path, don't match processes
    of programs run from different paths  (Closes: #160329)
  * init: 40_selinux.dpatch: Remove superfluous printf argument
  * init: Add 63_init_longer_procname.dpatch  (Closes: #336172)
  * init.8: Mention that entering runlevel 1 kills all processes
    (Closes: #238861)
  * update-rc.d.8: Mention that update-rc.d will not create multiple start
    or multiple stop symlinks for a service in a single runlevel directory.
    (Closes: #330155)
  * Update FSF address

  * Updated versioned dependency of sysvinit from sysv-rc version
    2.85-2 to version 2.86.ds1-1.2, to make sure init.d/rcS calls all
    init.d scripts with 'start' argument.  Let initscripts conflict
    with sysv-rc (<< 2.86.ds1-1.2) as well, to document that it need a
    newer sysv-rc to work properly. (Closes: #338966)
  * Added 91_sulogin_lockedpw.dpatch to make sure file systems can be
    fixed on machines with locked root accounts too, by presenting a
    shell in these cases. Patch from Ubuntu and Thom May.
    (Closes: #326678)
  * Make sure checkroot.sh calls mountvirtfs with argument 'start', to
    avoid usage message and making sure it is executed as it
    should. (Closes: #338966, #339351)
  * Print message when hostname is set.  Use default 'localhost' if no
    hostname is set in /etc/hostname, and no current hostname is set.
  * In mountall.sh, add '-e' to swapon call, to ignore missing devices
    when enabling swap.  Because of this, show error messages from
    swapon.
  * Add link to alioth project page in the Debian README.
  * Created new file /lib/init/functions.sh for functions common to
    scripts in initscripts.  Moved dir_writable() into it.
  * Add new function selinux_enabled().  Use it before running
    /sbin/restorecon.

    system call is ignored by the kernel for remount anyway. So this
    doesn't hurt even if the device is incorrect, and it fixes a
    platform dependant case where "mount -n -o remount,rw <whatever> /"
    fails with "mount: you must specify the filesystem type". That
    is a bug in mount(8): if you don't specify the type, it passes
    garbage to the kernel, and some archs choke on that.

  * Support for root on devices with a dynamic major, such as
    LVM and partitionable RAID. If the root device in /etc/fstab doesn't
    match up with the actual root device, we try to create a temporary
    device node in /dev/shm/root so fsck and remount rw can be done.
  * Use lstat() instead of stat() in the mountpoint(8) utility.
  * Fix checkroot devfs behaviour.
  * Hmm, /usr/bin/test -w works to check if a filesystem is readonly,
    but bash's built-in doesn't. Work-around with touch -a.
  * /lib/init/readlink was completely broken, argh. Fixed borkenness.
    Also changed behaviour so that readlink -ff is equivalent to realpath,
    and -f doesn't insist on the path being a symlink. (closes: #238611)

    manager to decide whether to put this in potato or not (closes: #61227).
  * Fix up /etc/init.d/README paths (closes: #58935,#58595)

  * Unmount remote filesystems before network is shut down
    (closes: #60898,#61907). This also was a release-critical bug.

  * Change src/Makefile for non-debian systems (mainly, RedHat)

sysvinit (2.74-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Should compile with glibc 1.99 :)
  * Now confirms to policy manual 2.4.0.0
  * Change behaviour of reboot(1) and halt(1) so that the default when
    the runlevel can't be determined is to call shutdown.
  * Updated README and skeleton
  * Depends on new dpkg for the new update-rc.d
  * Added re-exec patch from Al Viro (21 Feb 1998):
        'U' flag added to telinit. It forces init to re-exec itself
        (passing its state through exec, certainly).
        May be useful for smoother (heh) upgrades.
        24 Feb 1998, AV:
        did_boot made global and added to state - thanks, Miquel.
        Yet another file descriptors leak - close state pipe if
        re_exec fails.
  * Now no longer contains mdutils.sh and conflicts with older mdutils
  * /etc/rc.S/*.sh scripts that use set -e or exit no longer stop
    the whole boot process.
  * Fixes:

    #16977: sysvinit: libc6 twice into Pre-Depends

  * Use siginterrupt, now that system calls are restarted by default.
    Main symptom was that the sulogin timeout didn't work but there
    might have been more hidden problems.
  * Kill process immidiately if turned off in inittab
  * Fixed sulogin check on tty arg.
  * Use strerror() instead of sys_errlist
  * Chop up the reboot and halt scripts into seperate scripts. I had to
    take some liberties so they are called with the argument "stop" even
    though the scripts are Sxx scripts .. (start scripts in runlevel 0&6
    seem non-intuitive anyway)
  * wall now supports a '-n' option to suppress [most of] the banner.
    Debian doesn't use sysvinit's wall, but apparently Redhat does.
  * Add '-F' (forcefsck) option to shutdown
  * Depends on kbd_0.95-2 (or higher) package for /etc/rcS.d stuff.
  * Close and reopen /dev/initctl on SIGUSR1 (mainly for a /dev in ram)
  * Add FSCKFIX option to /etc/default/rcS
  * Wrote rcS.5 manpage describing /etc/default/rcS
  * Fixes bugs:
