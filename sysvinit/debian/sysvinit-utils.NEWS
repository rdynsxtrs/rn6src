sysvinit-utils (2.88dsf-17) unstable; urgency=low

  bootlogd has moved from sysvinit-utils to a separate bootlogd package. If
  you wish to continue using bootlogd, please install the bootlogd package.
  Note that the configuration file /etc/default/bootlogd and its option
  BOOTLOGD_ENABLE no longer exist; if you do not wish to run bootlogd, remove
  the bootlogd package.
