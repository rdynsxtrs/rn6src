                             ======================


 1. Viewing statistics and tunning your userland cache

 The script apc.php that comes with APCu provides detailed information
 about your cache statistics.  In Debian you will need to copy or
 symlink script from /usr/share/doc/php-apcu to your desired location
 (like a docroot) and access it from the browser.

 The script will provide additional graphics if you install the
 php-gd package.

 In order to understand the information and use it to tune you cache
 refer to the APCu documentation at: http://pecl.php.net/package/APCu
