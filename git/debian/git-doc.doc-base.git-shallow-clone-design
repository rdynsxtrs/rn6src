Title: Technical documentation for shallow clones in git
Author: Johannes Schindelin
Abstract: There has not been any work on the git fetch/clone
 --depth lately, so it is hard to find out what it does, and
 how.  This document describes the ideas as well as the
 current problems, and can serve as a starting point for
 shallow people.
